# Oracle Apex Evaluation

# Functional Characteristics

## Functionality

### Application Domain

1. Which features does the platform have?

**A:** Oracle Apex enables the building of database-driven web applications using graphic elements with wide compatibility with another Oracle’s tools. Furthermore, Oracle Apex provides a base applications library with varied contexts, like: data analysis and graphics generation; stock control; employer's control; calendar; among others. The EuD could start a project with one of the base applications and progress in development making modifications in the base functionality, could also increase new functionality. For experienced developers, Oracle Apex has an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with full support to SQL, PL/SQL, Javascript and basic web languages, integration with Web SOAP and REST APIs services, further the responsive interfaces with jQuery Mobile. The integration with Oracle’s database enables access to powerful functionality like data mining, spatial database, RAS, among others.
